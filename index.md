## Applied Geometry, Algebra, and Topology in Edinburgh (AGATE)

AGATE is an informal seminar for anyone at the University of Edinburgh who is interested in applied aspects (broadly construed) of geometry, algebra and topology. AGATE's remit spans topics including algebraic statistics, geometric deep learning, and topological data analysis. The seminar is open to computational, theoretical and statistical research as well as domain-specific applications.

**When:** Wednesdays 15:05 to 16:00  
**Autumn 2024 Location:** 3.10/3.11 [Dugald Stewart Building](https://maps.app.goo.gl/op8Ue9vbxhYPsty36)  

**Organizers:** [Sjoerd Beentjes](https://sjoerdvbeentjes.github.io/), [Darrick Lee](https://darricklee.com/), and [Emily Roff](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~emilyroff/)  

For the first semester, all talks will be by internal speakers. We welcome research talks and expository talks, by faculty, postdocs and students. You could tell us about your own latest paper, or something you've just read and found exciting. You could tell us the story of an interdisciplinary collaboration (what worked? what didn't?). Or you might like to give a "What is...?"-style introduction to your broad area of research. To propose a talk, email Sjoerd, Darrick or Emily.

To join the mailing list, send an email to sympa at mlist.is.ed.ac.uk with nothing in the subject line and in the message body put the following:

### Autumn 2024 Talks

<nobr><b>Oct. 2</b>  &nbsp; <a href="https://darricklee.com/">Darrick Lee</a></nobr>
<details style="margin-bottom:10px">
<summary><b>Path Signatures in Machine Learning </b></summary>
<p style="margin-left:30px;"> The path signature is a way to represent a path as an infinite sequence of tensors. We provide a high level introduction to signatures, highlighting the algebraic and geometric aspects of this construction, and discuss how this can be used to study sequences (time series) in machine learning.</p>

<details style="margin-bottom:10px">
<summary><b>Topological and Geometric Elements in Modern Deep Learning - Benefits and Challenges</b></summary>
<p style="margin-left:30px;"> This talk will take a simple introduction to machine learning, especially as used in computer vision. We then go on to see the different ways issues of geometry and topology turn up and are handled within the field. We examine the promise, in terms of generalisation, that building geometric understanding adds to a model. At the same time we recognise the challenges that imposing a rigid abstract geometry on a real world space can bring. I will give one example of our work decomposing structure and motion using a Hamiltonian model structure, before opening things up for discussion as to what the future opportunities are.</p>

<summary><b>Universal Approximation Properties of Deep Neural Networks: A Control Theory Perspective</b></summary>
<p style="margin-left:30px;"> In this talk, I will discuss the approximation properties of deep neural networks, with a particular focus on residual-type structures, a popular architecture in deep learning. We will conceptualize ResNet as a continuous control system, specifically as a parametric dynamical system. Based on this framework, we will explore the universal approximation and interpolation properties of deep neural networks. We show that any nonlinear activation function can have universal approximation property. Furthermore, we will discuss extensions to symmetric cases, including permutation and translation invariance, which are useful in scientific computing. This is based on joint work with Jingpu Cheng (NUS), Qianxiao Li (NUS), and Zuowei Shen (NUS).</p>

<details style="margin-bottom:10px">
<summary><b>Real Algebraic Geometry for Games and their Equilibria</b></summary>
<p style="margin-left:30px;"> The classical notion of Nash equilibria imposes the somewhat unnatural assumption of independent non-cooperative acting on the players of a game. In 2005, the philosopher Wolfgang Spohn introduced a new concept, called dependency equilibria, that also takes into consideration cooperation of the players. Dependency equilibria are, however, much more involved from a mathematical viewpoint.
 
This talk will give the necessary background in game theory and will show how basic (real) algebraic geometry can be used to study dependency equilibria and game theoretical questions in general. It is based on joint work with Irem Portakal.</p>
